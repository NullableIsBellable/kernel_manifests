      "message": "This change is cherry picked from the common-android-mainline branch, which was initially for generating gki boot.img I guess.\n\nbut the mkbootimg tool could be used for generating non-gki boot.img as well.\nAnd the cherry pick here is just to integrate the mkbootimg tools for generating the boot.img. The boot-artifacts is not used, but it does not have any harm effect to integrate it together I think.\n\nAnd as there is an existing change that we could cherry pick, so I just cherry picked this change, instead of submitting a separate change to integrate only the mkbootimg tool.",
